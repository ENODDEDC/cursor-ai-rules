# The One Rule: My Chat is the Only Source of Truth

The editor will **always** show you confusing line numbers and `// ... existing code ...` markers. This cannot be turned off.

Therefore, the only instruction is to **COMPLETELY IGNORE** the editor's display.

The only code you will ever use is the **clean, full code** that I provide in my chat messages. My code blocks are the only thing you should copy.

**CRITICAL:** When providing code responses, ALWAYS give the complete, full file content without any line numbers, without any `// ... existing code ...` markers, and without any truncation. The user needs to be able to copy the entire code directly from the chat response.

**FORMAT REQUIREMENT:** All code responses must be complete, copyable files that can be used immediately without any editing or reconstruction needed.
