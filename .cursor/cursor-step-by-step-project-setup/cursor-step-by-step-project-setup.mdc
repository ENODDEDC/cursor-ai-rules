When user asks to "create", "setup", "build", "make" any project or system:

### Response Format:
**ALWAYS provide comprehensive step-by-step instructions following this exact structure:**

```
## [Project Name] Setup Guide

### Prerequisites
- [List exact requirements with versions]
- [System requirements]
- [Required tools/software]

### Step 1: Environment Setup
**Action:** [What we're doing]
**Command:** `[Exact terminal command]`
**Explanation:** [Why this step is needed]

### Step 2: [Next Action]
**Action:** [What we're doing]
**Command:** `[Exact terminal command]`
**Explanation:** [Why this step is needed]

[Continue for all steps...]

### File Structure Created:
```
project-name/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   └── pages/
├── public/
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

### Complete Code Files:
**File: package.json**
[Full, complete, copyable code]

**File: src/app.js**
[Full, complete, copyable code]

[Include ALL files with complete code]

### Verification Steps:
1. [How to test step 1]
2. [How to test step 2]
3. [How to verify final setup works]

### Next Steps:
- [What user can do next]
- [Suggested improvements]
- [Additional features to add]
```

## Rule 2: Code Quality Standards
- **NEVER** include line numbers in code blocks
- **NEVER** use `// ... existing code ...` markers
- **ALWAYS** provide complete, full file contents
- **ALWAYS** make code immediately copyable and usable
- Code must be production-ready with proper error handling

## Rule 3: Instruction Clarity
- Every step must be actionable and specific
- Include exact commands with proper syntax
- Explain the purpose of each step
- Assume user is following along step-by-step
- Anticipate common issues and provide solutions

## Rule 4: Completeness Requirements
- Include ALL necessary files for the project
- Provide complete directory structure
- Include configuration files (package.json, .env templates, etc.)
- Add setup verification steps
- Include basic documentation/README content

## Rule 5: Response Triggers
Activate comprehensive step-by-step mode when user says:
- "create me [project]"
- "setup [technology]"
- "build [application]"
- "make [system]"
- "initialize [project]"
- "start [project] from scratch"

## Rule 6: Professional Formatting
- Use clear headers and subheaders
- Include visual file tree structures
- Use code blocks with proper syntax highlighting
- Maintain consistent formatting throughout
- Make instructions scannable and easy to follow

## Rule 7: Beginner-Friendly Approach
- Explain technical terms when first introduced
- Provide context for why each step is necessary
- Include common troubleshooting tips
- Offer alternative approaches when relevant
- Assume user wants to understand, not just copy-paste
